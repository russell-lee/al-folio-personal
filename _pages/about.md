I am a PhD candidate at the [Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences](https://cics.umass.edu) at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/).  My research interests include online optimization, algorithm design under uncertainty, and learning-augmented algorithms with machine learning predictions.  Much of my work is motivated by applications to energy efficiency and data center optimization.  Before UMass, I received a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Carnegie Mellon University with a minor in Computer Science.
