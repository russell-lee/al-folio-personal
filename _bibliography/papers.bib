abstract = {This paper develops learning-augmented algorithms for energy trading in volatile electricity markets. The basic problem is to sell (or buy) k units of energy for the highest revenue (lowest cost) over uncertain time-varying prices, which can framed as a classic online search problem in the literature of competitive analysis. State-of-the-art algorithms assume no knowledge about future market prices when they make trading decisions in each time slot, and aim for guaranteeing the performance for the worst-case price sequence. In practice, however, predictions about future prices become commonly available by leveraging machine learning. This paper aims to incorporate machine-learned predictions to design competitive algorithms for online search problems. An important property of our algorithms is that they achieve performances competitive with the offline algorithm in hindsight when the predictions are accurate (i.e., consistency) and also provide worst-case guarantees when the predictions are arbitrarily wrong (i.e., robustness). The proposed algorithms achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off between consistency and robustness, where no other algorithms for online search can improve on the consistency for a given robustness. Further, we extend the basic online search problem to a more general inventory management setting that can capture storage-assisted energy trading in electricity markets. In empirical evaluations using traces from real-world applications, our learning-augmented algorithms improve the average empirical performance compared to benchmark algorithms, while also providing improved worst-case performance.},

  abstract = 	 {For many application domains, the integration of machine learning (ML) models into decision making is hindered by the poor explainability and theoretical guarantees of black box models. Although the emerging area of algorithms with predictions offers a way to leverage ML while enjoying worst-case guarantees, existing work usually assumes access to only one predictor. We demonstrate how to more effectively utilize historical datasets and application domain knowledge by intentionally using predictors of <em>different</em> quantities. By leveraging the heterogeneity in our predictors, we are able to achieve improved performance, explainability and computational efficiency over predictor-agnostic methods. Theoretical results are supplemented by large-scale empirical evaluations with production data demonstrating the success of our methods on optimization problems occurring in large distributed computing systems.}

abstract = {This paper studies the online energy scheduling problem in a hybrid model where the cost of energy is proportional to both the volume and peak usage, and where energy can be either locally generated or drawn from the grid. Inspired by recent advances in online algorithms with Machine Learned (ML) advice, we develop parameterized deterministic and randomized algorithms for this problem such that the level of reliance on the advice can be adjusted by a trust parameter. We then analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms using two performance metrics: robustness that measures the competitive ratio as a function of the trust parameter when the advice is inaccurate, and consistency for competitive ratio when the advice is accurate. Since the competitive ratio is analyzed in two different regimes, we further investigate the Pareto optimality of the proposed algorithms. Our results show that the proposed deterministic algorithm is Pareto-optimal, in the sense that no other online deterministic algorithms can dominate the robustness and consistency of our algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the proposed randomized algorithm dominates the Pareto-optimal deterministic algorithm. Our large-scale empirical evaluations using real traces of energy demand, energy prices, and renewable energy generations highlight that the proposed algorithms outperform worst-case optimized algorithms and fully data-driven algorithms.}

 abstract = {This paper leverages machine-learned predictions to design competitive algorithms for online conversion problems with the goal of improving the competitive ratio when predictions are accurate (i.e., consistency), while also guaranteeing a worst-case competitive ratio regardless of the prediction quality (i.e., robustness). We unify the algorithmic design of both integral and fractional conversion problems, which are also known as the 1-max-search and one-way trading problems, into a class of online threshold-based algorithms (OTA). By incorporating predictions into design of OTA, we achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off of consistency and robustness, i.e., no online algorithm can achieve a better consistency guarantee given for a robustness guarantee. We demonstrate the performance of OTA using numerical experiments on Bitcoin conversion.}

abstract = {This paper develops competitive bidding strategies for an online linear optimization problem with inventory management constraints in both cost minimization and profit maximization settings. In the minimization problem, a decision maker should satisfy its time-varying demand by either purchasing units of an asset from the market or producing them from a local inventory with limited capacity. In the maximization problem, a decision maker has a time-varying supply of an asset that may be sold to the market or stored in the inventory to be sold later. In both settings, the market price is unknown in each timeslot and the decision maker can submit a finite number of bids to buy/sell the asset. Once all bids have been submitted, the market price clears and the amount bought/sold is determined based on the clearing price and submitted bids. From this setup, the decision maker must minimize/maximize their cost/profit in the market, while also devising a bidding strategy in the face of an unknown clearing price. We propose DEMBID and SUPBID, two competitive bidding strategies for these online linear optimization problems with inventory management constraints for the minimization and maximization setting respectively. We then analyze the competitive ratios of the proposed algorithms and show that the performance of our algorithms approaches the best possible competitive ratio as the maximum number of bids increases. As a case study, we use energy data traces from Akamai data centers, renewable outputs from NREL, and energy prices from NYISO to show the effectiveness of our bidding strategies in the context of energy storage management for a large energy customer participating in a real-time electricity market.}
